        <h1>Ray-Ban History</h1>
        
        <p>The history of the <em>Ray-Ban aviator</em> dates back to the <strong>1920s</strong>, when new airplanes allowed people to fly higher and farther. Many US Army Air Service pilots were reporting that the glare from the sun was giving them headaches and altitude sickness. In <strong>1929</strong>, when US Army Air Corps Lieutenant General <em>John MacCready</em> asked New York-based medical equipment manufacturer <em>Bausch and Lomb</em> to create army pilot sunglasses that would stop his men suffering headaches and nausea caused by the intense blue and white hues of the sky, a new kind of glasses was introduced. The prototype, created in <strong>1936</strong> and known as <em>Anti-Glare</em>, had plastic frames and green lenses that could cut out the glare without obscuring vision.The sunglasses were remodeled with a metal frame the following year and rebranded as the <em>Ray-Ban Aviator</em>. On <strong>May 7, 1937</strong>, <em>Bausch and Lomb</em> took out the patent, and the <em>Aviator</em> was born</p>

        <p>In <strong>1939</strong>, <em>Ray-Ban</em> launched a new version of the aviator called the <em>Outdoorsman</em>. It was designed for specific groups such as hunting, shooting and fishing enthusiasts, and featured a top bar called a <em>sweat bar</em> that was designed to catch sweat from falling into the eyes. They also featured temple end pieces to distinguish it from the standard aviator. A few years later, in the <strong>1940's</strong>, Gradient lenses were introduced. These were mirrored lenses which featured a special coating on the upper part of the lens for enhanced protection, but an uncoated lower lens for a clear view of the planeâ€™s instrument panel.</p>
